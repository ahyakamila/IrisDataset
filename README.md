#KNN
The K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN) algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm that uses the neighborhood classification as the predictive value of new instance values.
KNN's procedure started with An object (new sample) that is classified based on the most votes from its nearest neighbor class, then the object assigns to the most common class among its K nearest neighbors. (measured by distance function). KNN has 
The KNN algorithm has advantages and disadvantages :

Advantages :
Easy to implement
Classification is very good when applied to a large sample of data

Deficiency :
Sensitive to outliers
Need to determine the value of k
You need a large sample of data if you want great accuracy
